# Microcontroller Programming

by 羅紀翔

## Course Description

This course is designed for students new to microcontroller and embedded
systems in general. The course will focus on the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller,
specifically the STM32 series.

In this course, students will learn how the microcontroller works and how to
program it. With the aid of LAB exercises, students will gain hands-on
experience in microcontroller and ulimately be able to design and maintain
embedded systems. The following topics will be covered in this course:

- Microcontroller Architecture
- C Programming Language
- Software Development
- Embedded System Design
- Toolchains
- Debugging
- Embedded Operating Systems
- Zephyr RTOS

## Prerequisites

The students are expected to have a basic understanding of programming concepts
and basic C programming.

## Course Design

The course will be delivered in a series of lectures and LAB exercises. Each
lecture will cover two or three topics. The LAB exercises will be designed to
reinforce the concepts learned in the lectures. Additionally, there will be one
C technique in each lecture covering advanced C programming techniques.
