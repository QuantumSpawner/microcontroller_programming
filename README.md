# Microcontroller Programming

by 羅紀翔

## Course Description

This course is designed for students new to microcontroller and embedded systems in general. The course will focus on the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller, specifically the STM32 series.

In this course, students will learn how the microcontroller works and how to program it. With the aid of LAB exercises, students will gain hands-on experience in microcontroller and ulimately be able to design and maintain embedded systems. The following topics will be covered in this course:

- Microcontroller Architecture
- C Programming Language
- Software Development
- Toolchains
- Debugging
- Embedded Operating Systems
- Zephyr RTOS

## Course Design

The course will be delivered in a series of lectures and LAB exercises. Each lecture will cover two or three topics. The LAB exercises will be designed to reinforce the concepts learned in the lectures. Additionally, there will be one C technique in each lecture covering advanced C programming techniques.

## Prerequisites

The students are expected to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and basic C programming.

## Course Outline

TBD
